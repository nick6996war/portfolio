#OLX parser 
The OLX parser was created specifically for receiving cadastral numbers from advertisemeThe OLX parser was created specifically for receiving cadastral numbers from advertisements written in NODE.JS. Also, with a little refinement, it is possible to get anything from the OLX

PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION        
first: with the "index" document we collect all the links to ads from all pages and write them to a file.   
second: by compiling the links earlier, download the page and parse it into tags and get what we need, namely cadastral numbersnts written in NODE.JS.
